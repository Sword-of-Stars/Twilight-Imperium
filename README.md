# Twilight-Imperium
A training ground for a simplified version of the 4X game, Twilight Imperium

## Rules
The same rules hold as for the base game of Twilight Imperium; however, there are no factions, technology, action cards, or agenda phases. This game is purely about space risk; taking territory for oneself and denying it to others.

The strategy cards will be reduced in number, and modified as such:
Leadership - No change
Diplomacy - No change
Politics - Eliminated
Construction - No change
Trade - Eliminated
Warfare - No change
Technology - Eliminated
Imperial - Eliminated


At the end of each round, players score points based on the number of planets they control; Mecatol Rex is worth 5 points. 

**Victory Condition: The first player to 100 points wins the game**

## Extensions
Introduce factions (Arborec, Sol, Barony)
